		<h1>A Story of a Self-Taught Programmer</h1>
		<h2>Speaker <a href="" target="_blank">Omar Hisham.</a></h2>

		<p>
		Omar Hisham talked about the importance of self-learning for any community, especially Egypt, to develop.<br> 
		We usually complain about how the education system is mediocre and how we should improve it; 
		however, we never discuss the importance of finding your passion and aiming to learn about every aspect of it 
		without it being spoon fed to you and dig through all the open source content we have at the tip of our fingers 
		in the 21’st century regarding the topic, then actually going for it. <br>
		<br>
		Which is exactly what Omar did; only 12 years of age, Omar has already won a special award from Microsoft international 
		game programming contest as the youngest developer in the contest. 
		And with 2 games already to his name and definitely more to come. Omar set an example on the importance 
		of self learning through sharing his experiences </p>

		<h1>Suffering in a mute mode</h1>
		<h2>Speaker <a href="" target="_blank">Muhammed Hazem.</a></h2>

		<p>
		The Internet offers several opportunities for individuals out there to have anonymous, unrestricted and inexpensive 
		access to several unlimited range to inappropriate materials. 
		This is increasingly starting to present problematic issues which on the long run, is very likely to lead to 
		pornography addiction.<br>
		<br>
		Due to the fact that our community perceives pornography as a taboo, and not an addiction; 
		Hazem now is standing with courage and confidence, emphasising on how being in denial would 
		be one of the drawbacks of recovery. <br>
		Stating that to be able to solve a problem you need to be fully aware, and willing to admit 
		and take accountability for it, is where the journey to overcome it begins. <br> 
		Acknowledging the problems' existence would be one of the very first initiatives to overcome it. <br>
		<br>
		From suffering through it alone in a mute mode, to actually recognizing the problem and highlighting 
		the causes leading to it and finally permanately overcoming it, Hazem is willing to discuss 
		Porngraphy addiction and its causes stating that we could never be able to face a problem 
		without first admiting it and understanding it..</p>

		universes and story lines, which helps him unleash everything he is, <i>a gamer and a dreamer</i>.

		<h1>Art therapy: a world beyond creative expression</h1>
		<h2>Speaker <a href="" target="_blank">Carol Hammal.</a></h2>

		<p>
		Can art be a form of therapy? <br>
		Could art actually be equivalent to the common pain killers used in the Medical Industry?<br> 
		Shockingly, the answer is yes. <br>
		<br>
		Carol Hammal stuns us with how a twist of fate changed her life and introduced her to Art Therapy. 
		After studying in the United States Art Therapy, she decided to head back home and share what it is 
		she had learnt with the community; her own community. Just like her life has been forever changed, 
		she was hoping she could do the same to ours. Here she is, clarifying how art has the power to 
		improve both our physical and mental well-being. <br>
		This talk aims to create the first graduate Art Therapy Program. She also highlights one of her patient's
		journey through therapy. Her talk raises awareness for this exceptional phenomenon to emerge. <br>
		<br>
		Pain and suffering does indeed vary; coming in all kinds, but perhaps art could be the remedy? Let us find out!.</p>

			What is TEDx?
			<br/>
			
			In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TED has created a program called TEDx. TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. Our event is called TEDx[name], where x = independently organized TED event. At our TEDx[name] event, TEDTalks video and live speakers will combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events, including ours, are self-organized.
