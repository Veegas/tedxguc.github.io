            <h2 class="talkTitle">A Story of a Self-Taught Programmer</h2>
            <h2>Speaker <a href="http://www.tedxguc.com/speaker/0" target="_blank">Omar Hisham.</a></h2>

            <p>
            Omar Hisham talked about the importance of self-learning for any community, especially Egypt, to develop.<br> 
            We usually complain about how the education system is mediocre and how we should improve it; 
            however, we never discuss the importance of finding your passion and aiming to learn about every aspect of it 
            without it being spoon fed to you and dig through all the open source content we have at the tip of our fingers 
            in the 21â€™st century regarding the topic, then actually going for it. <br>
            <br>
            Which is exactly what Omar did; only 12 years of age, Omar has already won a special award from Microsoft international 
            game programming contest as the youngest developer in the contest. 
            And with 2 games already to his name and definitely more to come. Omar set an example on the importance 
            of self learning through sharing his experiences </p>

            <h2 class="talkTitle">Suffering in a mute mode</h2>
            <h2>Speaker <a href="http://www.tedxguc.com/speaker/0" target="_blank">Muhammed Hazem.</a></h2>

            <p>
            The Internet offers several opportunities for individuals out there to have anonymous, unrestricted and inexpensive 
            access to several unlimited range to inappropriate materials. 
            This is increasingly starting to present problematic issues which on the long run, is very likely to lead to 
            pornography addiction.<br>
            <br>
            Due to the fact that our community perceives pornography as a taboo, and not an addiction; 
            Hazem now is standing with courage and confidence, emphasising on how being in denial would 
            be one of the drawbacks of recovery. <br>
            Stating that to be able to solve a problem you need to be fully aware, and willing to admit 
            and take accountability for it, is where the journey to overcome it begins. <br> 
            Acknowledging the problems' existence would be one of the very first initiatives to overcome it. <br>
            <br>
            From suffering through it alone in a mute mode, to actually recognizing the problem and highlighting 
            the causes leading to it and finally permanately overcoming it, Hazem is willing to discuss 
            Porngraphy addiction and its causes stating that we could never be able to face a problem 
            without first admiting it and understanding it..</p>

            <h2>Speaker <a href="http://www.tedxguc.com/speaker/0" target="_blank">Carol Hammal.</a></h2>

            <p>
            Can art be a form of therapy? <br>
            Could art actually be equivalent to the common pain killers used in the Medical Industry?<br> 
            Shockingly, the answer is yes. <br>
            <br>
            Carol Hammal stuns us with how a twist of fate changed her life and introduced her to Art Therapy. 
            After studying in the United States Art Therapy, she decided to head back home and share what it is 
            she had learnt with the community; her own community. Just like her life has been forever changed, 
            she was hoping she could do the same to ours. Here she is, clarifying how art has the power to 
            improve both our physical and mental well-being. <br>
            This talk aims to create the first graduate Art Therapy Program. She also highlights one of her patient's
            journey through therapy. Her talk raises awareness for this exceptional phenomenon to emerge. <br>
            <br>
            Pain and suffering does indeed vary; coming in all kinds, but perhaps art could be the remedy? Let us find out!.</p>
